=======================

An opengl 3d renderer. Github recommended the title, and I happen to think it's brilliant. Unlike *some* people, I support github's creative endeavors.

###Usage

Running 'make' will produce a runnable binary, which takes a model as an argument and renders it to the screen. If you'd like to try and play with the engine, edit engine.cpp.

Eventually make will produce a compiled lib file that you can include in your personal projects, but we're not there just yet. Consider this a preview ;)
